<h1>Intro to Programming - Udacity Nanodegree</h1>
<p>Here I will summarise the main ideas I learn during the Nanodegree</p>

<h1>Stage 0: Getting started with HTML</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

- Basic understanding of how the web works.<br>
- Understanding of how <b>users, computers, servers, http</b>, and <b>the internet</b> all fit together.

<h2>Part 2</h2>
- Use of <b>HTML tags</b> <br>
- <b>Tag</b>: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag (the paragraph tags, or the bold and italics tags are examples of this). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the "break" tag). <br>

- <b>Element</b>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>

- <b>Attribute</b>: This is a property of an HTML element. The href attribute of the "a" element, specifies a link, for example.

<h2>Things I learnt in this lesson</h2>
<p>1. What a webpage is</p>
<p>2. How coding works</p>
<p>3. Computers are stupid</p>
<p>4. Programmers can't remember everything</p>
<p>5. Basic HTML vocabulary</p>
